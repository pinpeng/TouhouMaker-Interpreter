This is execute_string!  A small library of scripts that can parse and execute text as GML code.
It supports all built in functions and assets in the resource tree, such as objects, sprites, and scripts.

You can find helpful information on usage in the project itself.  Supported actions are listed in the
Supported Keywords note, and special extra functions are listed in Special Functions



To execute a string, you simply write the code and run it in the function like so:
execute_string("show_message(\"This code is being executed!\")");

TO ADD TO YOUR OWN PROJECT
Be sure to include the scripts in this project, the extension, and the object sys_eval.
The rest is included for demonstration purposes.
